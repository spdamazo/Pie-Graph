# Pie-Graph

Name: Stephanie Maru 
Course: SODV2101 - Rapid Application Development
Assignment 2: Graphs

Overview
Create a custom control that draws a graph of your choice.

Directions
Start by selecting a type of graph you would like to draw. Some options are listed below along with their functional requirements. If there is a different type of chart you would like to work on, check with your instructor for assignment scope.
Submit an application that includes your custom graph, as well as some means of entering data to be displayed in the graph.

Pie Chart
Draw a pie chart given a list of numbers. Numbers do not have be percentages of the pie. For example, if the user entered 10, 20, and 10, the chart would have 3 slices that covered 25%, 50%, and 25% of the pie. Each slice should have a different color, shading, or some easy way of identifying it.
Bonus: Display a legend on the pie chart with each section labelled.

I used ChatGPT to assist me with writing the function below. I gave it the following
prompt:
* How to set up legend for the pie graph
* Put in comments
* Give up to 15 colors for the pie graph
* Help to correct any syntax error
